# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
My name is LetÃ­cia, and I am passionate about cybersecurity and programming. Currently, I am focused on enhancing my knowledge and skills in these areas through self-study, relevant courses, and practical projects. As a self-taught learner, I have developed valuable competencies in project management, problem-solving, and strategy, making me efficient both in my studies and in task execution.
